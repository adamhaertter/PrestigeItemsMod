# Prestige Items (Beta)
**v0.2.0**

Adds a few items to the game inspired by some (mostly) base game mechanics. Some ideas are a bit powerful, but we're working to keep things balanced. I have a good bit planned for this mod, so more to come in the future! Can you figure out where we're taking this?

This is my first mod, so I'm still learning. If you have an issue with the mod or the balance, let us know below. That's why we're in beta after all.

## Issues

Have an issue with the mod? Find a bug? Think everything we've made is horribly imbalanced? Let us know over on GitHub by [opening an issue](https://github.com/adamhaertter/PrestigeItemsMod/issues) so we know to address it!

### Known Bugs
We are currently aware of these bugs and plan to fix them in the future:
- The outline of Charting Fungus & Parasitic Symbiosis do not cover the entire model. I know how to fix this, but haven't gotten around to it yet.

 Also if you're gonna make a mod, please make sure you have the right version of Unity so you don't have to start all over after you already sank 5 hours into learning how to do everything. Go to the modding discord and type in `!versions` and save yourself the tears. :(
