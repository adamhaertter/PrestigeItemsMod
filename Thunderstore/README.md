# Prestige Items (Beta)
**v0.0.1**

Adds one whole item to the game. Wow! Is it balanced? No not really, but it's fun and it taught me how to make an item.

I'm currently learning how to mod, and this is my work from following the tutorial lol. At least the item I made is somewhat original. :)


## Items

Note: You can spawn in the Dev Cube by pressing F2 while in a game. This is leftover from the Boilerplate demo. This is probably incompatible with any other mod that uses that keybind, though.

#### Common
| Icon | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![DevCube Icon](https://i.imgur.com/cVVPURL.png) | Dev Cube | Killing an enemy grants the holder a random status buff for 4 (+1 per stack) seconds. |

 Thanks to the [Modding Wiki Tutorials & Boilerplate](https://risk-of-thunder.github.io/R2Wiki/Mod-Creation/Getting-Started/First-Mod/), the [Henry Tutorial](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/HenryTutorial), and [KomradeSpectre's Aetherium Item Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TsF8elv_m0). I literally would have pulled my hair out if I didn't have these to reference.

 Also if you're gonna make a mod, please make sure you have the right version of Unity so you don't have to start all over after you already sank 5 hours into learning how to do everything. Go to the modding discord and type in `!versions` and save yourself the tears. :(
